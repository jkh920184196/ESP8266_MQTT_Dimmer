# ESP8266_MQTT_Dimmer
This is the code for the project ESP8266 based AC Dimmer made using Generic ESP8266 Module and some other basic components.
In this project I have used Ubidots MQTT server for wireless communication.

The original code for ESP8266 based dimmer was written by Nasir Malik. I have just edited the code to make it work with Ubidots 
MQTT server.
